# Heart Attack Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health parameters. It utilizes a machine learning model to analyze input features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and more, to provide an estimation of the probability of a heart attack.

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `data` directory. The dataset includes various features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and the target variable indicating the presence or absence of a heart attack.

## Model

The machine learning model used for heart attack prediction is implemented using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). The trained model is saved in the `model` directory.
